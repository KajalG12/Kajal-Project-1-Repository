# Project 1: Air-Pollution Project

* The Air Pollution is an in-depth analysis of air pollution data, created by me, a skilled data analyst with expertise in data visualization and analysis.

* the project was based on a dataset sourced from kaggle and utilized a range of powerful tools and technologies,including Microsoft power Bi for data visualization,
microsoft SQL server management studio for database management and python jupyter for data analysis.

* I utilized ETL techniques to extract data from source, transform it into a more usable format, and load it into a target system. 

*the resulting analysis provides valuable insights into patterns and trends of air pollution  over time, 
including significant increase in air pollution levels over the past few decades, impact of human activities on air quality
